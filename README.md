# hugo.d093w1z.com

A personal blog/website built using Hugo — static, fast, and self-hosted.  
The site is maintained via Markdown + Hugo → automatically built and deployed.  

---

## Overview

This repository contains the full source for my personal website/blog, generated by Hugo. It includes:

- Site content (posts, pages) written in Markdown  
- Theme, layout templates, static assets (CSS, JS, images)  
- Configuration (`hugo.toml`) and data files (e.g. language, metadata)  
- CI/CD workflow to build and deploy automatically on push  

The result is a fully static website: no heavy backend, just fast-rendered HTML/CSS/JS.

## Why Hugo

Hugo is a high-performance static site generator, written in Go, known for its speed and simplicity. It converts Markdown content + theme templates into a complete static website, typically rendering sites with thousands of pages in seconds. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Benefits of this setup:  
- Zero runtime dependencies — no databases or servers needed  
- Git-based workflow: content versioned, reviewable, reversible  
- Easy hosting via static site platforms or self-hosting

## Getting Started (for local development)

1. Install Hugo (preferably the extended version). 
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d093w1z/hugo.d093w1z.com.git
   cd hugo.d093w1z.com

3. Run Hugo’s development server to preview locally:
   ```bash
   hugo server -D

4. Open `http://localhost:1313` in your browser — you’ll see the live site.

## Deployment & Workflow

* The repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/…`) that builds the site and publishes it on every push to `main`.
* On deployment, Hugo generates a static version of the site in the `public/` folder, which gets served as the live site. This technique is commonly used when hosting a Hugo site on services like GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider. ([gohugo.io][1])
* Content creation is simple: write Markdown files (e.g. blog posts), commit & push → Hugo rebuilds → site auto-updates.
