<p>More formally, I’m <b>Mukesh Tandale | d093w1z</b>, and I’ve been programming for the past 8 years, starting my journey at the age of 16 as a self-taught programmer. My fascination with computers led me to earn a <b>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.</b></p>
<p>Here, you’ll find a collection of my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and <a href="/posts">blog</a> posts covering topics that excite me the most: Linux, C++, and web development using the MERN stack.</p>
<p>When I’m not coding, I love tinkering with my Linux setup and diving into a good <a href="/tags/book">book</a>. Join me as I explore the ever-evolving world of technology!</p>
