Hi, I'm Mukesh Tandale, known online as [**d093w1z**](/posts/2024-07-28-d093w1z/) — a curious engineer with a hacker mindset, always exploring the edges where hardware, software, and human experience intersect.

I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in C++, Linux systems, and modern web technologies like the MERN stack. Whether it's writing low-level code, building responsive web apps, or crafting CLI tools that actually make life easier, I thrive on building things that are fast, clean, and purposeful.

Currently, I’m working at Dassault Systèmes, where I build robust solutions that power next-gen digital tools. I'm love constantly leveling up through side projects, open-source contributions, and deep technical reading.

**📍 Based in India | 🎓 B.E. in Computer Engineering**

Outside work, I’m working on:

    A home-lab setup to help my day to day technology interactions.

    A clean and minimalist blog (this site!) to share what I learn along the way

💡 **Interests**

    Systems programming, embedded computing, and performance tuning

    Personal knowledge management (Obsidian, Syncthing, Markdown workflows)

    Open-source culture, digital minimalism, and ethical tech

    Defense and aerospace tech, tactical analysis, and Indian R&D ecosystem

🛠️ **Tech I'm Comfortable With**

    Languages: C++, JavaScript, Python, Bash

    Stacks: MERN, Docker, Hugo + GitHub Pages, Express, Shopify

    Tools: Linux , Proxmox, Cloudflare, Anki, Syncthing, Jellyfin
